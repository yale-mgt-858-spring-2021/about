Hello üëãüëã! This is the "about" page for [MGT858 "Database
Systems"](https://858.mba) at the Yale School of Management in Spring 2021.
This is the first time I'm teaching this course and I'm super jazzed about it
ü§©ü•≥. This is a living document ‚Äî you can track changes by looking the git
commits.

MGT858 introduces enrolled students to the database systems used in modern
technology companies.  You will emerge from this course an SQL ninja,
well-prepared for tech sector roles including data scientist, product manager,
and technical program manager.  The first half of the course covers relational
databases (those that use SQL, generally) and the latter half covers other
kinds of systems including key-value stores, document databases (noSQL),
distributed databases, graph databases, blockchain databases.  We will discuss
the business case for each of these database such that you ought to emerge from
the course able to think of a software product or service and describe what
kind of database systems ought to be used to build that product.  You will not
learn how to build such systems, though you will learn a little bit about their
internals. You will definitely learn how these systems can be used to answer to
the kinds of analytics questions you will encounter as a manager.  The
coursework includes *twice-weekly* homework assignments and a final
examination, all of which require writing code and must be submitted using the
git version control system.  (Experience with git is not required; however,
some experience programming is necessary. The particular language does not
matter.) Students can expect to spend perhaps six hours per week on homework.


I don't know how many students will enroll in this course. As of Nov 24th, 2020,
65 SOM students are registered for the course. I suspect we'll get some non-SOM
students who wish to enroll in the course and also some SOM students who drop.
(Yale College students are welcome to enroll and will require a form signed by
both Kyle Jensen and your residential dean.)
I likely will *not* accept shoppers or auditors. The number of admitted students
will be affected by the room to which we're assigned and, of course, by the
social distancing practices in place at the time.

## <a name="covid"></a>Covid dystopia clusterfarce 2019/2020/2021 ü¶†üò∑üî¨üå° 

Yale SOM is doing its utmost to ensure you, students, have the best
possible experience during the Covid-19 pandemic. I do not know right
now what form teaching will take in Spring-2. I told the registrar that
I would teach in "hybrid" mode in which I will teach from Evans every
day, knowing that some of you will join online (by Zoom) and some of you
will come to Evans as you are willing and able. I am committed to ensuring
you have a fantastic experience no matter what mode of learning
we find ourselves.

Please take a moment to review the [student accessibility
services](https://sas.yale.edu/faculty/online-courses-and-covid-19-response)
information about COVID-19. If you have accessibility needs, please let me know
so that I can meet them!

## How to use this document/repo

Because our class info and policies are tracked using git, you can see if and
how they change over the course of the semester. Further, you have the ability
to make changes yourself---please send me a pull request. Similarly, if you
feel these documents are lacking, please open an
"[issue](https://github.com/yale-mgt-858-spring-2021/about)" on GitHub for this
repo and we'll address the issue. Finally, because our git repo is hosted on
GitHub, you can easily receive push notifications of changes to this repo.
(Woot!)

## Office hours

The office hours for each of the teaching staff is shown
below. Though, if you are reading this before the start of
the semester, it is possible some staff are missing because
they did not yet determine their schedule. Office hours will
likely be held virtually.

Feel free to send an email if these times do not work for you.

## Development environment

You will need to write code a lot of code this semester, mostly domain-specific
query languages like [PostgreSQL-flavored SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), the [ElasticSearch
DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html), and
the [Redis query commands](https://redis.io/commands). It is possible you'll need to write
code in a more general programming language like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
or [Go](https://golang.org/). I haven't finished the homework assignments, so I don't know
yet. I'm weary to make you write too much code because I want to make the class manageable
for those with limited computer science backgrounds. But, I also want you to learn about
database systems üòú and so some coding will be required. 

Most of the homework assignments and the final exam will require using the [git
version control system](https://git-scm.com/) for submission. You'll sign up
for GitHub, join the [yale-mgt-858-spring-2021
organization](https://github.com/yale-mgt-858-spring-2021) on GitHub and
submit your assignments (in part) by pushing up code to GitHub. Usually I'll
give you some starter code like empty `.sql` files with examples queries.
When you complete your assignments, you'll make git commits and push those
commits up to GitHub so that I can download your answers and test them.
Obviously this requires knowing a little bit of git. I'll point you to some
git tutorials, but I'm not going to teach git in class. You are forewarned
üòâ. You can [read more about git here](github.md).

You can complete the homework assignments on any kind of computer: Windows,
Mac, Linux, whatever. You'll almost certainly need to install some software in
order to do so. Obviously you'll need git. You might also need _ clients_ for
different database systems. For example, you will almost certain need a
PostgreSQL client or a Redis client.  The `$XYZ` _client_ is a piece of
software that connects to the `$XYZ` _server_ in order to send the server
queries (or other commands) and interpret the responses. (Here, `$XYZ` is a
stand-in for PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.) Now, it could be that you don't
want to set up the `$XYZ` client software on your computer, which would be totally resonable: it
can be a pain in the rear-end. For this reason, I will give each student an
[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) environment, for which I will pay
ü§ë.  Cloud9 is an integrated development environment that includes a shell and
a code editor running on a Linux virtual machine. If you choose to use C9, rad.
But, it's not a panacea; if you use Cloud9 you'll be on a Linux environment so
you might have to learn some Linux-foo üêß. I will use Cloud9 for all my 
tutorials (eg. videos I make to assist you with homework) and I will offer
guidance on how to set up your Cloud9 environment in order to complete homework.
But, in general I will _not_ offer guidance on how to install the `$XYZ` client/server
on your personal computer.

You can access Cloud9 through the link in your Dashboard on the [class
website](http://858.mba).  Therein you should see credentials for logging into
Cloud9. You'll need to supply an account number, username, and password. All
that is in your dashboard under the "user secrets" section. (I won't create the
Cloud9 environments until the beginning of the semester.)

## Preparing for the course

I am receiving a few emails from students about how best to prepare for the
class. There's a few ways to think about doing so. One is to prepare narrowly
for the content you're going to encounter. For SQL, in my person opinion, the
best way to do so is going through the exercises at
[SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/).  I think that website is fantastic and it's
part of the assigned reading in class. For the other database systems we'll
use, the answer is less clear.  You can read about
[ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) (the representative
full-text search database we'll use);
[ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) (the representative
columnar store we'll use); [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) (the
representative caching database we'll use);
[MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) (the representative noSQL
database we'll use); and [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j) (the
representative graph database we'll use).

A second way to prepare is to level-up your computer skills in general,
particularly your *nix skills. A good resource for doing so is [MIT's missing
semester course](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/).

Finally, you might think about getting your personal computer set up for
writing code. That usually starts with choosing a package manager
([homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on Mac OS and
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows) and choosing a [good code
editor](https://github.com/collections/text-editors). I use
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/).

Also üòú, you'll want to be familiar with [git](https://git-scm.com/). You can
find [many tutorials
online](https://medium.com/@javinpaul/top-10-free-courses-to-learn-git-and-github-best-of-lot-967aa314ea).
Your use of git this semester will be super simple because you won't generally
have collaborators. If you like, you can use a [git GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
I use GitHub Desktop often, mostly for line-by-line staging of changes.


## Textbook

There is no textbook for the course. Readings will be posted on the
[class website](https://858.mba).

## Diversity, equity, inclusion and their opposites

This class will be an inclusive environment. If you see behavior
that you feel is discriminatory, _particularly_ from the professor
or teaching staff, we encourage you to avail yourself of one or
more of the following resources.

- [Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct at Yale Booklet](https://smr.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Guide-Preventing-and-Responding-to-Sexual-Misconduct.pdf)
- [Yale
  Sexual Harassment and Assault Response & Education (SHARE)](https://sharecenter.yale.edu/)
- Diane Temple in SOM Human Resources and Sheri Scully in the SOM AASL.
- [Yale Title IX Coordinators](https://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/coordinators) (SOM‚Äôs Title IX Coordinator is Rebecca Udler)
- [Yale's Live Safe App](https://your.yale.edu/community/public-safety/campus-safety-services/livesafe-app)
- [Office for Equal Opportunity Programs](https://equalopportunity.yale.edu/)

## Homework assignments

We will have roughly ten homework assignments and ten pre-class quizzes. That's
a *lot* of work!  All of the homework assignments will be submitted to
GitHub using git. Further, you'll be responsible for at least one in-class news
item.

## Quizzes

Most classes are preceded by a quiz that you take
through the class website. The quizzes are short, timed, multiple choice,
mandatory, and ultimately a crude and imperfect assessment of
the degree to which you understand the pre-class reading material.
The following are my reasons for giving pre-class quizzes:

1. It makes you think about the upcoming class!
2. Empirical evidence shows that the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
   increases your understanding and retention of material.
3. They give you a low-stakes, super-small reward for coming to class prepared.
4. They ensure that your classmates are better prepared for class and therefore more fun to speak with.
5. They are short, you can google for stuff during the quiz, _and_ you
   can drop your lowest two scores, so they are not stressful.

You take the quizzes via the class website. Click on "meetings" then click on
the meeting for a particular class. (You can also take the quizzes via the
class API. If you're a masochist, contact me! ü§™) A button that says "Begin Quiz"
will appear if you can take the quiz.  Once you begin a quiz, you can change
your answers until either 15 minutes after you began the quiz, or the closing
time of the quiz, which is usually the beginning of class. So, if you start a
quiz five minutes prior to class, you will only have five minutes to submit the
answers to the quiz questions! The quizzes are graded only after the quiz
closes. Kyle will sometimes go over the content of the quizzes at the beginning
of class.

You can take the quiz if all of the following are true:

- The quiz is not labeled as "draft". Draft means the teaching
  staff are still working on the quiz questions.
- The current time is after the quiz is "open". Quizzes usually
  open five days before the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds.
- The current time is not after the quiz is "closed". Quizzes
  usually close when the meeting/lecture to which the quiz
  corresponds begins.
- You did not previously take the quiz or you already started
  the quiz, but your time to take the quiz is not expired.
  All quizzes this semester will last 20 minutes.

Once you click "Begin Quiz", you will see a list of multiple
choice questions displayed in an HTML form. For each question,
you should select the options you desire and then click
"Save Answers" at the bottom of the page. Unless there is an
error, the options that you selected will be labeled as "saved",
so that you have visual confirmation.

A few notes about the quizzes...

* The quiz questions are not uniformly drawn from material in
  the pre-class reading. Some pre-class reading will be over-represented
  and some under-represented either, usually because of heterogeneous
  importance of the pre-class reading material.
* We want the quiz questions to test your conceptual understanding.
  We do not want to ask "gotcha" questions or simple recall questions.
  However, we will fall short in those aspirations often.
* Some quiz questions will have obvious answers. We do this in part
  to remind you of important concepts.
* If you feel like a quiz questions is unfair or that the answer
  is wrong, please tell Kyle. It is easy for Kyle to "fix" a bad
  question.
* Questions that have multiple correct answers are indicated as
  such in the class website.
* There is a timer at the bottom of the page in the quiz UI on 
  the class website. It shows the *approximate* time you have left
  to finish your quiz. Please monitor your time.
* It is 100% fine to google for the answers to quiz questions or to
  look in the reading material. You may not rely on another human
  being for real-time support on the quiz and you may not share
  information about the quiz with other students.

## Grading

Grading will follow the [official Yale SOM grading
policy](https://portal.som.yale.edu/page/grade-policy-mba-mam-mms).  That is
_essentially_ a forced curve: a certain number of students get each grade: HH,
H, etc. In my opinion, it's a quite generous curve (though [the ethics of
grading on a curve are
dubious](https://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=1153&context=elj).
I will compute the grades for non-SOM students by overlaying their school's
grading scale on top of the SOM curve. There's not a 1-to-1 correspondence.
Your letter grade will be based on your sum grade and your sum grade will be
determined _roughly_ as follows (I reserve the right to make changes. The most
common change I make is dropping assignments.)


| Component       | Percentage            | 
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Homework     | 35% | 
| Quizzes   | 35% | 
| Final exam   | 20% | 
| Participation   | 10% | 

The ethics of counting participation in the grade are also a bit dubious üôÅ.
But, I'm including it for consequentialist reasons: your participation makes
the class more fun for all of us and most importantly for me ü§£.

## Class meetings

This is a half term course. You can see the schedule here: [https://858.mba](https://858.mba).
Notice that we will meet on 4/8 even though Yale College does not.
